Overview:
This project aims to classify web pages into different categories based on their content. The classification task involves using machine learning models to analyze the text data of web pages and predict their categories. Various models, including traditional machine learning algorithms and neural networks, are explored for this task.

Features:
Utilizes word embeddings, TF-IDF vectorization and Topic Modelling for feature representation.
Implements multiple machine learning models for text classification, including:
1. Random Forest
2. XGBoost
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Neural Networks and
5. Ensemble methods
Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Usage:
Modify the script to customize preprocessing steps, feature representation techniques, and machine learning models based on your specific task and dataset.
Experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and evaluation metrics to improve performance.
